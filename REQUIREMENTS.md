## Overview

Corporation X,Y,Z aims to develop a notification service that allows clients to send SMS and email notifications. Each client has a specific limit on the number of requests they can send per month. The service needs to handle potential performance issues due to too many requests from clients.

## Functional Requirements

### API Development

1. The system should provide APIs for sending SMS and email notifications.
2. The APIs should accept request data, including recipient details and message content.
3. The APIs should validate request data and handle errors appropriately.

### Rate Limiting

1. The system should limit the number of API requests a client can make within a certain time period.
2. If a client exceeds their rate limit, the system should respond with a '429 Too Many Requests' status code.

### Quotas

1. The system should limit the number of API requests a client can make on a monthly basis.
2. If a client exceeds their monthly quota, the system should prevent further requests until the quota resets.

### Caching

1. The system should cache frequently accessed data to reduce server load.

### Message Queue

1. The system should use a message queue to handle and distribute tasks to different services.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Scalability

1. The system should be able to scale up or down based on load.
2. The system should maintain performance during peak load times.

### Reliability

1. The system should have high availability and minimize downtime.
2. The system should handle errors gracefully and not crash under unexpected conditions.

### Security

1. The system should secure client data and API requests.

## System Requirements

### Infrastructure

1. The system should be built using .NET Core, SQL Server, RabbitMQ, Redis Cache, and other necessary Microsoft technologies.
2. The system should be containerized using Docker for consistent deployment.

### Load Balancing

1. The system should distribute network traffic across multiple servers to prevent any single server from being overwhelmed.

## Operational Requirements

### Monitoring and Logging

1. The system should provide detailed logs for debugging and issue resolution.
2. The system should have robust monitoring to identify and alert for any performance issues or system errors.
